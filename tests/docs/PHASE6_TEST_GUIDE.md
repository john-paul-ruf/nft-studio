# Phase 6: Plugin Lifecycle Integration Tests - Execution Guide

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All tests implemented with real objects, real cleanup

## Overview

Phase 6 provides comprehensive integration tests for the complete plugin system. Tests use **real objects, real file operations, NO MOCKS** - they actually install plugins, create files, test caching, and verify cleanup.

## Test Files

### 1. `plugin-lifecycle.integration.test.js` - Core Lifecycle Tests
Tests the fundamental plugin operations and cache system.

#### Test Functions:

**`testPluginFullLifecycleCycle()`** - Full Install → Load → Uninstall
- Creates a real test plugin
- Installs it to the registry
- Verifies it's registered and available
- Uninstalls it completely
- Verifies cleanup
- **Validates**: Core install/uninstall flow works end-to-end

**`testCachePersistenceAndValidation()`** - Cache Save/Load/Validate
- Saves registry data to cache file
- Loads cache from disk in fresh session
- Validates cache with same plugins (should pass)
- Validates cache with different plugins (should fail)
- Invalidates cache and verifies deletion
- **Validates**: Cache persistence works across sessions

**`testMultiplePluginsInstallAndRegistry()`** - Multi-Plugin Registry Management
- Installs 3 plugins simultaneously
- Verifies all appear in registry
- Verifies all are enabled
- Disables one plugin
- Verifies disabled state
- Uninstalls all plugins
- **Validates**: Registry handles multiple plugins correctly

**`testPluginEnabledStateResilience()`** - Enable/Disable State Persistence
- Installs a plugin (enabled)
- Disables it
- Verifies disabled state persists in registry
- Re-enables it
- Verifies enabled state persists
- **Validates**: Plugin state changes are properly saved

**`testInvalidPluginHandling()`** - Error Handling
- Attempts to install from non-existent path
- Attempts to remove non-existent plugin
- Verifies proper error handling
- **Validates**: System gracefully handles invalid operations

**`testCacheCorruptionRecovery()`** - Cache Corruption Detection
- Creates valid cache
- Intentionally corrupts cache file
- Attempts to load corrupted cache (should fail)
- Rebuilds new cache successfully
- **Validates**: Cache corruption is detected and recoverable

### 2. `plugin-lifecycle-edgecases.integration.test.js` - Edge Cases
Tests special scenarios, performance, and unusual conditions.

#### Test Functions:

**`testConcurrentPluginOperations()`** - Concurrent Install/Uninstall
- Creates 3 test plugins
- Installs all 3 concurrently using Promise.all()
- Verifies all installed
- Uninstalls all 3 concurrently
- **Validates**: System handles concurrent operations safely (no race conditions)

**`testPluginReinstallScenario()`** - Install → Uninstall → Install Again
- Installs a plugin
- Verifies it's registered
- Uninstalls it
- Verifies it's removed
- Reinstalls the same plugin
- Verifies it's registered again
- **Validates**: Can reinstall plugins without side effects

**`testPluginToggleSequence()`** - Multiple Enable/Disable Cycles
- Installs plugin (enabled)
- Performs sequence: disable → enable → disable → enable → enable
- Verifies each state change takes effect
- **Validates**: Toggle operations are idempotent and reliable

**`testCacheChecksumAccuracy()`** - Cache Checksum Validation
- Creates cache with 2 plugins
- Verifies identical registry has same checksum
- Adds a 3rd plugin → checksum changes
- Modifies plugin path → checksum changes
- **Validates**: Checksums correctly detect all changes

**`testLargePluginSetPerformance()`** - Performance with 10+ Plugins
- Installs 10 plugins (mixed enabled/disabled)
- Measures install time per plugin
- Queries registry to fetch all
- Uninstalls all plugins
- **Validates**: Performance remains acceptable with large sets
- **Metrics**: Logs average time per operation

**`testRegistryConsistencyUnderLoad()`** - Rapid Operations Stress Test
- Installs 5 plugins
- Performs 20 rapid toggle operations
- Verifies registry integrity (all plugins present, valid state)
- Checks each plugin has complete metadata
- **Validates**: Registry remains consistent under heavy load

## Test Output Format

Each test produces detailed output:

```
🧪 Test Name

📦 Phase 1: Operation Description
─────────────────────────────────
✅ Action completed
✅ Result verified
   Additional info: details

🔍 Phase 2: Next Operation
─────────────────────────────────
✅ Action completed

✨ Test Name PASSED: Summary of what was verified
```

### Exit Codes
- `0` - All tests passed
- `1` - One or more tests failed
- Summary report printed at end

## Interpreting Results

### Successful Test
```
✨ Test PASSED: Description of what was verified
```

### Failed Test
```
❌ Test FAILED: Error message explaining what went wrong
   Stack trace for debugging
```

### Performance Metrics
Tests log performance data:
```
✅ Installed 10 plugins in 2500ms
   Average per plugin: 250ms
```

Look for performance regressions compared to baseline.

## Cleanup Verification

Each test performs complete cleanup:
1. Creates isolated temp directory
2. Performs operations in temp directory
3. Cleans up all created files
4. Verifies cleanup (checks no orphaned files remain)

**Important**: The test environment automatically cleans up after each test. If a test fails, cleanup still happens to prevent pollution of subsequent tests.

## Common Test Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Cache file not found
**Cause**: App data path not configured for test
**Solution**: Tests automatically set up isolation directory. Check TestEnvironment setup.

### Issue: Plugin installation fails
**Cause**: Invalid test plugin or permission denied
**Solution**: Check that temp directory is writable and test plugin JSON is valid

### Issue: Concurrent tests conflict
**Cause**: Tests using same plugin names
**Solution**: Tests use unique names with timestamps. Should not happen.

### Issue: Registry shows stale data
**Cause**: Cache not invalidated between tests
**Solution**: Each test creates fresh environment. Clear cache between manual tests.

## Debugging Tests

### Enable Verbose Logging
The tests use `SafeConsole` for logging. Output shows:
- ✅ Successful operations
- ❌ Failed operations
- ℹ️ Information messages
- ⚠️ Warnings

### Add Custom Logging
Modify tests to add console.log for debugging:
```javascript
console.log('DEBUG: Plugin state:', plugin);
```

### Check Temp Directories
Test temp directories are cleaned up automatically but can be inspected during debugging by adding a pause before cleanup.

## Performance Baseline

Expected baseline times (will vary by system):

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Install single plugin | 50-200ms |
| Save cache | 10-50ms |
| Load cache | 5-20ms |
| Validate cache | 5-15ms |
| Toggle enable/disable | 20-100ms |
| Query 10 plugins | 10-50ms |

If times exceed 2x these values, investigate performance regression.

## Next Steps After Tests Pass

1. ✅ Run all tests and verify passing
2. ✅ Check performance baselines
3. ✅ Review coverage report
4. ⏭️ Move to Phase 7: Documentation & Cleanup
5. ⏭️ Create UI components (Phase 5)
6. ⏭️ Full system testing

## Test Architecture

### Real Objects Pattern
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Real service instances
const pluginManager = testEnv.getService('PluginManagerService');
const result = await pluginManager.addPlugin(data);

// ❌ WRONG - Mocked/stubbed
const pluginManager = { 
    addPlugin: async () => ({ success: true }) 
};
```

### Test Isolation
```javascript
// Each test gets fresh environment
const testEnv = await new TestEnvironment().setup();

// Perform operations
// ...

// Always cleanup, even on error
await testEnv.cleanup();
```

### Assertion Style
Tests use imperative assertions:
```javascript
if (!result.success) {
    throw new Error(`Expected success but got: ${result.error}`);
}
```

This ensures real behavior is tested, not mocked expectations.

## Adding New Tests

To add a new Phase 6 test:

1. Create test function in appropriate file
2. Export with `export async function testMyNewTest() { ... }`
3. Use `TestEnvironment` for setup/cleanup
4. Get real services via `testEnv.getService()`
5. Make real operations
6. Verify real results with explicit checks
7. Cleanup automatically happens

Example:
```javascript
export async function testNewScenario() {
    const testEnv = await new TestEnvironment().setup();
    
    try {
        console.log('\n🧪 Test: New Scenario\n');
        
        const service = testEnv.getService('SomeService');
        const result = await service.operation();
        
        if (!result.success) {
            throw new Error('Operation failed');
        }
        
        console.log('\n✨ Test PASSED: Scenario verified\n');
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('\n❌ Test FAILED:', error.message);
        throw error;
    } finally {
        await testEnv.cleanup();
    }
}
```
