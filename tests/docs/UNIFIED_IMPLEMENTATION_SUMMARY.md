**File**: `tests/unit/CommandService.test.js` (enhance existing)

**Test Scenarios to Add**:
- [ ] Command stack overflow handling (max 50 commands)
- [ ] Concurrent command execution prevention
- [ ] Undo/redo to specific index boundary conditions
- [ ] Command execution failure rollback
- [ ] Event emission on command lifecycle
- [ ] Effect vs non-effect command filtering

**Success Criteria**:
- 90%+ code coverage
- All edge cases tested with real objects
- Zero test failures
- Performance within baseline (<100ms)

#### Task 1.2: ResolutionMapper Testing (6 hours)
**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**File**: `tests/unit/ResolutionMapper.test.js` (CREATE NEW)

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Get dimensions with orientation swap
- [ ] Parse string resolution (all formats: "1080p", "1920x1080", etc.)
- [ ] Closest resolution calculation
- [ ] Invalid resolution error handling
- [ ] Naturally portrait detection
- [ ] Display name generation
- [ ] Category filtering (Standard, HD, 4K, etc.)

#### Task 1.3: PositionScaler Testing (10 hours)
**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**File**: `tests/unit/PositionScaler.test.js` (CREATE NEW)

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Scale factors calculation accuracy
- [ ] Boundary clamping edge cases
- [ ] Arc path radius scaling with aspect ratio changes
- [ ] Nested position scaling recursion
- [ ] Legacy Point2D vs Position object consistency
