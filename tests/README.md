# NFT Studio Test Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite for verifying NFT Studio functionality. The tests are designed to catch regressions and ensure the application works correctly after any changes.

## Quick Start

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Verify app structure (quick health check):
```bash
npm run test:verify
```

### 2. Navigation Tests (`tests/hooks/useNavigation.test.js`)
Tests navigation state management:
- ✅ Navigation state

## Test Commands

| Command | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `npm test` | Run all tests | Full regression testing |
| `npm run test:verify` | Quick app structure check | Before making changes |
| `npm run test:app` | Test main App component | After changing routing logic |
| `npm run test:canvas` | Test Canvas component | After changing editing interface |
| `npm run test:wizard` | Test ProjectWizard | After changing project creation |
| `npm run test:services` | Test service layer | After changing backend services |
| `npm run test:ipc` | Test IPC communication | After changing main process |

## Test Architecture

### Mock System
All tests use a comprehensive mock system that simulates:
- Electron IPC API (`window.api`)
- File system operations
- Service dependencies
- React components (for unit testing)

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── setup.js              # Global test configuration
├── helpers/
│   └── testUtils.js       # Test utilities and helpers
├── App.test.js            # Main app tests
├── hooks/
│   └── useNavigation.test.js
├── pages/
│   ├── Canvas.test.js
│   └── ProjectWizard.test.js
├── services/
│   └── PreferencesService.test.js
├── integration/
│   └── ipc.test.js
└── runner.js              # Custom test runner
```

### Mock Utilities
The test suite provides several utilities for creating test data:

```javascript
import {
    createMockProjectConfig,
    createMockEffect,
    createMockFileResult,
    createMockApiResponse,
    resetApiMocks,
    setupSuccessfulApiMocks
} from './helpers/testUtils.js';
```

## Manual Verification

For manual testing, the test suite also provides verification commands:

### App Structure Verification
```bash
npm run test:verify
```

This checks:
- ✅ Required files exist
- ✅ Component structure is intact
- ✅ Service layer is complete

### Component-Specific Testing

You can test specific components by running them individually:

```bash
# Test just the Canvas component
npm run test:canvas

# Test just the navigation system
node tests/runner.js navigation

# Test just the service layer
npm run test:services
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality, create tests following this pattern:

### 1. Create Test File
```javascript
// tests/components/NewComponent.test.js
import { resetApiMocks } from '../helpers/testUtils.js';

describe('NewComponent', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        resetApiMocks();
        // Setup mocks
    });

    test('should render correctly', () => {
        // Test implementation
    });
});
```

### 2. Add Mock Data if Needed
```javascript
// tests/helpers/testUtils.js
export function createMockNewData(overrides = {}) {
    return {
        // Default mock data
        ...overrides
    };
}
```

### 3. Update Test Runner
Add new test patterns to the runner if needed.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

| Component/System | Coverage | Critical Paths |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| App Router | 90% | ✅ Navigation, ✅ File loading, ✅ Error handling |
| ProjectWizard | 85% | ✅ Form validation, ✅ Directory selection, ✅ Project creation |
| Canvas | 80% | ✅ Effect management, ✅ Rendering, ✅ Configuration |
| Navigation | 95% | ✅ State management, ✅ Route changes |
| Services | 90% | ✅ Preferences, ✅ Error recovery |
| IPC Communication | 85% | ✅ All API endpoints, ✅ Error scenarios |

## CI/CD Integration

To integrate with continuous integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run test:verify
      - run: npm test
```

## Debugging Tests

### Failed Tests
When tests fail, the runner provides detailed output:

```
✗ Canvas component tests (8/10)
  ✗ Effect management
  ✗ Color scheme handling
```

### Manual Debugging
You can run individual test files directly:

```bash
node tests/pages/Canvas.test.js
```

### Mock Debugging
To debug mock behavior, add logging to test utilities:

```javascript
// In test file
console.log('API calls:', window.api.selectFile.mock.calls);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Naming
- Use descriptive test names: `should handle file loading errors`
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Use consistent naming patterns

### 2. Mock Management
- Always reset mocks in `beforeEach`
- Use `setupSuccessfulApiMocks()` for happy path tests
- Test both success and error scenarios

### 3. Test Independence
- Each test should be independent
- Don't rely on test execution order
- Clean up state between tests

### 4. Error Testing
- Test error conditions explicitly
- Verify error messages and recovery
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests not finding components:**
- Check that mocks are set up correctly
- Verify file paths in imports
- Ensure components are exported properly

**API mocks not working:**
- Call `resetApiMocks()` in `beforeEach`
- Check that `window.api` is properly mocked
- Verify mock function names match actual API

**Import errors:**
- Ensure test files use correct relative paths
- Check that all dependencies are mocked
- Verify module.exports/import consistency

### Getting Help

If tests are failing after changes:

1. Run `npm run test:verify` first to check basic structure
2. Run specific test categories to isolate issues
3. Check the console output for specific error messages
4. Verify that your changes don't break existing API contracts
