```

### Next Phase Ready:
Phase 5 has successfully established the foundation for continued UI component decomposition. The extracted services demonstrate proven patterns for:
- Single responsibility principle
- Event-driven loose coupling
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimization
- Maintainable service boundaries

# PHASE 6: EventBusMonitor Decomposition
*Duration: Week 8*

## Step 6.1: EventBusMonitor Comprehensive Testing ⏳ **NEXT**
   ```javascript
   // src/components/forms/EffectFormRenderer.jsx
   // src/components/forms/EffectFormValidator.js
   // src/components/forms/EffectFormSubmitter.js
   // src/components/effects/EffectConfigurer.jsx (refactored, target <300 lines)
   ```

2. **Maintain Test Coverage**
   - All 11 comprehensive tests must continue to pass
   - Add component-specific tests for extracted components

### Verification:
```bash
npm test
# All tests must pass
# EffectConfigurer should be < 300 lines
```

## Step 5.3: Decompose EventBusMonitor ⏳ **PLANNED**
**Objective**: Break down 1,050-line component

### Planned Actions:
1. **Create Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Component structure and initialization tests
   - Event monitoring and filtering tests
   - Event export functionality tests
   - UI component integration tests
   - Performance baseline tests

2. **Extract Components**
   - EventMonitorDisplay.jsx
   - EventFilterPanel.jsx
   - EventExporter.js
   - EventBusMonitor.jsx (refactored, target <300 lines)

### Verification:
```bash
npm test
# All tests must pass
# EventBusMonitor should be < 300 lines

3. **Run System Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:system
   ```
   - Verify end-to-end workflows

4. **Performance Verification**

# ROLLBACK PLAN

If any step fails:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1
   npm run test:all
   ```

2. **Identify Issue**
   - Review failing tests
   - Check performance metrics
   - Validate functionality

3. **Fix and Retry**
   - Address root cause
   - Re-run verification steps
   - Proceed only when all tests pass
